The installation process for alti+server is very straight forward.  The
software consists of two necessary files.

  1. alti+server
  2. custom_json_commands.txt

There are two choices for the second file.  If you require your server
to run more than 75 maps, it is recommended you use the file from GitHub
named small_custom_json_commands.txt and rename it.  If you can safely
run with fewer than 75 maps, you should use the original file.  It provides
help to users on how to use the custom commands, making the server much
easier to use and administrate.


======================
Step 0, Setup Altitude
======================
You must install altitude, and use the server_configurator to setup your
server before beginning.  This is true if you use alti+server or not.
When configuring your server, remember that you can only have one server
if you use alti+server.  server_configurator allows you to configure
multiple servers, as the base Nimbly code supports this.  However, this
does not work with alti+server.


=======================
Step 1, the alti+server
=======================

Copy this file to wherever you want.  It does not need to be co-located
with the Altitiude software, the author stores this code in the account
which runs the software's ~/bin directory.

Find the $INSTALL_ROOT variable and change it to the directory where you
installed the altitude server.  This defaults to ~/altitude, as that is
what the altitude.sh program defaults to.  If you chaned this value when
you installed altitude, then change it here too.

Some people like to install server maps in a seperate location like
~/altitude/maps/download.  If this is the case for you, set $MAPDIR
to be the part of that location past "maps/".  In our example, you would
set $MAPDIR to 'download'.  It is recommended that you only change this
if you must.  You can server more maps, and it is easier on server users
to server files from the root maps directory.

Edit this file and find the %OPITIONS section very close to the top.  Here,
review and change any options you need.

If you set 'superAdmin' to 'list', then add the vaporId of any super admins
to the @SUPER_ADMINS array just below %OPTIONS.

Next, change the @MOTD to say whatever you would like new users to see when
they login.  Each element of the array will be a new line and message from
the server.

Save this file, it is configured and ready for your use.


=======================
Step 2, the alti+server
=======================
Copy the appropriate custom_json_commands.txt file to your ~/altitude/servers/
directory (or wherever you installed altitude).  This file should be in the
same location as your launcher_config.xml file.

Choose the standard file first, and only switch to the small version of the
file (you will have to rename it from small_custom_json_commands.txt to
custom_json_commands.txt) if you need to run more than 75 maps on the server.


=========================
Step 3, Start alti+server
=========================
You should be ready to go to start your server, give it a try.
