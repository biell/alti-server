The installation process for alti+server is very straight forward.  The
software consists of one file which contains all necessary code and information:

  alti+server


======================
Step 0, Setup Altitude
======================
You must install altitude, and use the server_configurator to setup your
server before beginning.  This is true if you use alti+server or not.
When configuring your server, remember that you can only have one server
if you use alti+server.  server_configurator allows you to configure
multiple servers, as the base Nimbly code supports this.  However, this
does not work with alti+server.


=======================
Step 1, dependencies
=======================

If your systems is a bare-bones installation, you may have to install
some of these dependencies.  Many systems already have them all.

Required:
  1. perl
  2. perl-JSON-XS
  3. perl-XML-Simple
  4. perl-Curses
  5. perl-Digest-SHA
  6. perl-TermReadKey

Recommended:
  1. GeoIP
  2. curl

Optional:
  1. git
  2. screen, or
  3. tmux
  4. java (you may need a different one from what comes with altitude)

Each of the above packages has it's own dependencies which should be taken
care of by your package manager.

=======================
Step 2, the alti+server
=======================

Copy this file to wherever you want.  It does not need to be co-located
with the Altitiude software, the author stores this code in the account
which runs the software's ~/bin directory.  If you prefer to keep the code
up-to-date via GIT, you can also create a symbolic link from this location
to where you keep the code checked-out.

Find the $INSTALL_ROOT variable and change it to the directory where you
installed the altitude server.  This defaults to ~/altitude, as that is
what the altitude.sh program defaults to.  If you chaned this value when
you installed altitude, then change it here too.

Some people like to install server maps in a seperate location like
~/altitude/maps/download.  If this is the case for you, set $MAPDIR
to be the part of that location past "maps/".  In our example, you would
set $MAPDIR to 'download'.  It is recommended that you only change this
if you must.  You can server more maps, and it is easier on server users
to server files from the root maps directory.

You have to options to configure how the software works.  One method is to
edit the defaults in %OPTIONS at the top of the script.  This is nice,
because it ensures these settings even on first boot.  The downside is that
you will have to redo them after a software update.  The second options is
to skip this step for now, and start the software.  After that, there is a
"/server" command available from the console only.  You can use it to
"list", "set", "unset", "add", and "del" (the last to for arrays) values
which get stored in your persistent "json_stash.txt" file.  These values
will then persist across software updates, as the "json_stash.txt" values
override what is present in the %OPTIONS hash.

If you are placing these values directly into the code, edit and save this file,
it is configured and ready for your use.  If you used the "/server" command
to set these values on a running instance, the values take automatic effect
and the server is configured for use.  There a number of options, but you
really should consider taking immediate action on configuring the following:


  * altBouncer  -  Setting this to 1 will tell your server to upload players
    seen to Tec27's altBouncer.  This is an important resource in the Altitude
    community to find players when they change their names.  This setting
    is only disabled by default because it generates network traffic to
    Tec27's server (it sends an XML stream) and something like that shouldn't
    be on without the server administrator's knowledge.  Unless you have a
    good reason, you should run "/server set altBouncer 1" from console.

  * noviceLevel & aceLevel  -  Altitude allows you to specify a minimum level
    to join a server.  But, that level applies to all ace levels.  Depending on
    how you designed your server, an aceLevel (Ace 1 - Ace 10) of 21
    (unlocked all planes) might be sufficient to join the server.  But, new
    players may still need to be restricted.  Under this situation, you could
    set noviceLevel to 35 to ensure they have the extra skills required to
    participate on the server.  The defaults for these values is set to
    noviceLevel=8 (unlock blue perk) and aceLevel=3 to illustrate the
    concept.  It is entirely possible you wish to set these values to
    1 (or even 0), and you should strongly review these settings.  To disable
    from console, run: "/server set aceLevel 0" and "/server set noviceLevel 0".

  * snarkChance  -  This is set to the liklihood that the server makes a
    snarky comment.  It defaults to 16, meaning there is a 1 in 16 chance.
    You can disable this useless server chatter by setting snarkChance to 0.
    If you want some server chatter, but not a lot, you could also set it
    very high, setting it to 100 would make comments very infrequent.  If you
    don't want your server talking to players, then set this to 0.

  * allowUploads  -  One of the aspects of the alti+server wrapper is its
    ability to help server administrators upload maps.  This is on by default
    if your server has the "curl" program installed.  If you only want to add
    maps the old fashioned way, you should disable this.  There are other
    settings (superAdmin and superAdmins) which allow you to control who
    and from where these commands work.  Look into those if you wish to keep
    this functionality in a restricted fashion.

=========================
Step 2, Start alti+server
=========================
You should be ready to go to start your server, give it a try.  It is highly
recommended that alti+server be run from a detatchable terminal.  Good
choices are GNU Screen, tmux, and dtach.  This will allow for the game server
to continue to function normally, even in the event of a disconnect.

At this time, there is no version of alti+server which can run headless, and
in the background.
